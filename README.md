# IDK - An All-In-One music Station/Server/App

### IDK?
> IDK stands for I dont know - that's exactly what it means (and it's true i really dont know).

### Supported Music Apps
comming soon:
	* Spotify
	* YouTube
	* SoundCloud

### Issues
	* Spotify doesn't work in chrome-headless - so it opens a chrome-browser instance (windows)

### How to install
	* load that shet
	* 'npm install' that shet
	* Put your Credentials in the .env file
	* 'npm start' starts the server
	* goto localhost:.env-port (or your domain whatever) in your browser
	* thats it
